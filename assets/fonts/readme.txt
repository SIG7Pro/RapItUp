These fonts come from many different places, a few of them I know where from. I searched up free to use fonts for video games for a few of these, and the others were fonts from some video games.
Extra info is on font-notes.txt, where there's a [#], feel free to find the number in there.
 - Do either Control + F, or Command + F (if on Mac) to do a quick search for your number.

Fonts I searched for:
- Junction by Caroline H and Tyler F.
  - https://github.com/theleagueof/junction
  - Under the SIL Open Font Liscence (OFL)
  - Compiling for web should comply with statement 2.2 in the "Open Font Liscnce FAQ.markdown" file, as compiling for web translates TTF and OTF files to WOFF if I'm not mistaken.
  - More info about this font on the download.
- Orbitron by Matt McInerney
  - https://github.com/theleagueof/orbitron
  - Also under the SIL Open Font Liscence. :)
- Eirian by GGBotNet
  - https://ggbot.net - They have so many fonts I couldn't refind where I downloaded it from.
  - https://ggbot.itch.io/eirian-font - Nevermind, I used my browsing history.
  - Also under the Open Font Liscence, except this time it is in a standard text file.
- Robotronika also by GGBotNet
  - https://ggbot.itch.io/robtronika-font - This time I had to search manually for it.
  - https://www.dafont.com/robtronika.font - Apparently its on dafont too since I found their profile there. I might use more fonts from there.
- Aero_03 by Jean-Micheal L
  - https://www.dafont.com/aero-03.font - I had to search this one up to refind it.
  - This one is under the CC BY-ND 4.0 Liscence (Attribution-NoDerivatives 4.0 International)
  - In a nutshell, you must give appropriate credit to the author of the font, you're unable to make any deriatives (remixes, transformations, or anything built off of) but you're able to state minor changes made, and you aren't allowed to put anything that restricts others from following the liscence.

Fonts previously found/liked:
(Note, while I didn't originally get these from the URls provided, they've been attatched for the sake of convinience.
However, I did download three of these to get more info about them, VCR OSD Mono, Ubuntu, and Pixel Arial 11.)

- VCR OSD Mono (vcr.ttf)
  - Apparently by Riciery Leal, and submitted to dafont without a liscence. (https://www.dafont.com/vcr-osd-mono.font#null)
  - However, Font Meme has it listed by "mrmanet" under free for commercial use. [1]
  - I can only either assume Riciery and mrmanet are the same person, or one is copying one another. But both get some credit here.
- Ubuntu (Font) by Dalton Maag.
  - Ubuntu and Canonical are trademarks of Canonical Ltd, pretty cool.
  - https://design.ubuntu.com/font - https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Ubuntu?query=Dalton+Maag - http://launchpad.net/ubuntu-font-family/
  - Registered to the Ubuntu Font Liscence temporarily. [2]
- Pixel Arial 11 (Bold, pixel.otf) by someone named Max
  - On the Font Meme website, the URL associated leads to https://sevmusic.com.
  - For all I've seen, its listed as being free to use, not much info.
  - https://www.fonts4free.net/pixel-arial-11-font.html - On the Fonts4Free website, a readme.txt is attatched, stating its just the font Arial at 11 pixels.
   - This font has a hard to determine liscence. [3]
- Monsterrat (Font) by Julieta U.
  - https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat - https://fonts.adobe.com/fonts/montserrat#about-section
  - Under an Open Source liscence (source: Adobe Fonts)
- Captura Now by Anita J.
  - https://www.typethis.studio/p/captura-now-font-family/
  - It appears the font is only for Desktop services or websites, and the full font is $75 dollars, so I think I might be using the trial font for the time being. Not sure, as the trial font on the website is seemingly unavailible for me to download, nothing shows up!


  Remember everyone, use your fonts wisely!
