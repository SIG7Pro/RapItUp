Welcome!

This game is still in development.

Placeholder name: RapItUp

----------------------------------------------------

Inspired by games like Friday Night Funkin' and Parappa The Rapper!

Still in progress, expect some messy code. Placeholder graphics also used. Arrows from Friday Night Funkin'.
Shoutouts to Astromina Engine. I'll consider working on that again when I get a good framework for this to get started on. 

----------------------------------------------------

Requirements:

Haxe
HaxeFlixel
Flixel Addons
Lime
(Haxe) OpenFL (potentially)

Should be simple to install and setup. Try referring to https://haxeflixel.com/documentation/getting-started/ for help.

I'll write a more detailed install and compile list when this is in a more favorable state.

haxelib install lime
haxelib install openfl
haxelib install flixel
haxelib run lime setup flixel
haxelib run lime setup
haxelib install flixel-addons

command line stuff above
if you get errors, make an issue, requires a github account
