This readme contains nothing as I'm making it as a dummy file for what could be done differently if I was smarter.
What I plan to do is like make this file, clone it to my PC, then take all the GitHub stuff, move it to the original RIU folder, then delete the new one, then I can push the existing files into the current thing.
Not sure if it'll work, but who knows? It might as well!

(I can't clone an empty repository, for those wondering.)
