This game is a soon to be playable rhythm game made in HaxeFlixel, inspired by the likes of [Friday Night Funkin'](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371) and Parappa the Rapper.

Still in progress, expect some messy code. Placeholder graphics also used. Arrows from Friday Night Funkin'.

Installing this requires compiling it from the source code, because as of writing, there is no proper release.

Check out [Compiling.md](Documentation/Compiling.md).
