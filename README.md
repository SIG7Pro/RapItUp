Welcome!

The project here, Rap-It-Up, is still in progress. However, for those who'd like to read further, you may.

This game is a **soon to be** playable rhythm game made in HaxeFlixel, inspired by the likes of [Friday Night Funkin'](https://www.newgrounds.com/portal/view/770371) and [Parappa The Rapper](https://www.playstation.com/en-us/games/parappa-the-rapper-remastered/).

Still in progress, expect some messy or incomplete code. Placeholder graphics also used.

Installing this requires compiling it from the source code, because as of writing, there is no proper release.

Check out [Compiling.md](Documentation/Compiling.md).

Special Thanks:

- To everyone.
