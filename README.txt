Rap-It-Up / Indev.
Still in progress.

Inspired by games like FNF, PTR, and DDR.

Requires Haxe, HaxeFlixel, Lime, and OpenFL (HX). Lime and OFL should be installed when installing HaxeFlixel, so don't fret.
When compiling, try doing either:
lime test hl -debug
or
lime test (OS) (replace OS with ur operating system)

To every company that has VTuber stuff and has the player require permission from the developers and whatnot (apparently that exists), you have full perms.
Make sure the game is at least seen 50% of the screen and not anime tits!
